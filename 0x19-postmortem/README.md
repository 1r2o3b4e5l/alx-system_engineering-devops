Summary
     Duration of the outage:
           Start Time: 2024-08-11, 01:00 PM 
                 End Time: 2024-08-15, 02:30 PM 
impact :
      What service was down/slow? 
         During the outage, the primary  website was inaccessible to all users.
    What were users experiencing?
             Users were unable to connect into their website , those who were already connected were unable to send any requests (messages).
    How many % of the users were affected?
             Approximately 100% of users were affected, leading to significant customer frustration and potential revenue loss.
   What was the root cause?
    caused by a misconfiguration in the Nginx server configuration file. A syntax error in the configuration file prevented Nginx from restarting properly after a routine maintenance update, causing the entire web stack to become unavailable.

 Timeline:
      When was the issue detected?
             01:00 PM : Issue detected when automated monitoring systems reported that the website was unreachable.
          How was the issue detected?
            01:05 PM: Initial investigation began by checking the web server logs. The logs indicated that Nginx had failed to start after a configuration update.
         actions taken 
         01:15 PM : Assumed that the issue might be related to the recent server patch applied during maintenance. This was a misleading investigation path.
      misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken
          01:25 PM: DevOps team was notified and joined the investigation. They quickly identified that the Nginx server was not running.
     which team/individuals was the incident escalated to
        01:35 PM: The Nginx configuration file was inspected, revealing a syntax error that was introduced during the latest update.

  how the incident was resolved
    01:45 PM: Configuration file was corrected, and the Nginx server was restarted successfully.
  02:00 PM: Full functionality of the website was restored.
  02:30 PM: Monitoring confirmed that the website was stable and all services were fully operational.
 Root cause and resolution:
    Root Cause:
        The root cause was a syntax error in the Nginx configuration file. During a routine update, a typo was accidentally introduced in the configuration file, which caused Nginx to fail during the restart process. Since Nginx is responsible for routing incoming traffic to the appropriate application server, the entire web stack was rendered inaccessible.
      Resolution:
            The issue was resolved by manually correcting the syntax error in the Nginx configuration file. After the correction, the Nginx service was restarted, which restored the website's availability. Additionally, the corrected configuration was tested in a staging environment before reapplying it to production.
 Corrective and preventative measures:
     what are the things that can be improved/fixed :
        1, Automated Configuration Testing: Implement automated testing for Nginx configuration files before applying changes to the production environment.
          2, Rollback Mechanism: Develop and deploy a rollback mechanism that automatically reverts to the last known good configuration if an error is detected during a restart.
          3, Enhanced Monitoring: Improve monitoring to detect web server failures immediately and alert the team to specific configuration issues.

Task List:
Implement a syntax checker that runs automatically before Nginx configurations are applied.
Develop a script to automatically rollback to the previous configuration if Nginx fails to start.
Update the deployment process to include configuration testing in the staging environment.
Review and update documentation on Nginx configuration procedures, followed by training sessions for the engineering team.
